# Instructor's Guide

Welcome to the Instructor's Guide for *Information Systems: An ABET
CAC-aligned Intelligent Textbook*. This guide explains every feature
of the textbook, how to use it in your classroom, and how to customize
it for your students. No prior technical knowledge is assumed — every
technical term is defined before it is used.

    <img src="../img/mascot/welcome.png" class="mascot-admonition-img" alt="Iris welcomes instructors">
    Welcome, instructor! You're about to teach a course where the
    field is being rewritten on a quarterly basis. That sounds
    intimidating, but it's actually the best news you'll get all
    semester — your students get to learn IS *as it actually is right
    now*, not as it was in 2019. This guide will help you make the
    most of every feature in the book.

## About This Interactive Intelligent Textbook

### What is an Intelligent Textbook?

An **intelligent textbook** is a digital textbook that goes beyond
static text and images. It includes interactive simulations, self-grading
quizzes, a searchable glossary, and a structured map of how concepts
relate to each other. The goal is to give students a richer, more
engaging learning experience than a traditional printed textbook.

### The Five Levels of Intelligent Textbooks

Not all digital textbooks are created equal. We categorize intelligent
textbooks into five levels based on how interactive and adaptive they
are:

<iframe src="https://dmccreary.github.io/intelligent-textbooks/sims/book-levels/main.html"
  height="500px" scrolling="no"></iframe>

| Level | Name | Description | Example Features |
|-------|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Level 1** | Static Digital | A PDF or basic web version of a print textbook | Text and images only, no interactivity |
| **Level 2** | Interactive | Adds interactive elements like simulations, quizzes, and searchable glossaries | MicroSims, self-check quizzes, concept search |
| **Level 3** | Adaptive | Adjusts content based on student performance | Personalized learning paths, difficulty adjustment |
| **Level 4** | AI-Assisted | Includes an AI tutor that can answer student questions | Chatbot integration, automated feedback |
| **Level 5** | Fully Adaptive AI | Continuously learns from student interactions and optimizes the experience | Real-time content generation, predictive analytics |

**This textbook is a Level 2 Intelligent Textbook.** It includes 43
interactive MicroSims, per-chapter quizzes, a 64-term glossary, an
FAQ, curated references, and an interactive learning graph viewer
covering all 580 concepts.

### What Makes This Textbook Different

- **Interactive MicroSims** let students manipulate models directly in
  their browser — no software installation required.
- **AI integrated throughout the curriculum** — five chapters (19–23)
  treat AI as a load-bearing IS competency, not as a special exhibit.
- **ABET CAC-aligned** — coverage maps to the 2025–2026 ABET Computing
  Accreditation Commission Information Systems program criteria and
  the ACM/AIS IS2020 guidelines.
- **Systems thinking throughout** — every chapter trains students to
  ask three questions: *What else does this touch? What's the tradeoff?
  Where does this surprise us?*
- **"Managing IS can become your superpower"** — a positive,
  empowering tone that frames hard concepts as power-ups, not warnings.
- **Iris the Hummingbird** — a friendly mascot character (called a
  "pedagogical agent") who appears throughout each chapter with tips,
  encouragement, and key insights.
- **Completely free and open source** — licensed under Creative
  Commons for non-commercial use.

## Using the Chapters

### Chapter Structure

The textbook contains **25 chapters** organized into seven parts.
Concepts build on each other, so students should generally work
through chapters in order:

| Chapters | Topic Area |
|----------|------------|
| 1–2 | Foundations and the role of IS in organizations |
| 3–5 | IS architecture, application development, and business process management |
| 6–9 | Data management — foundations, modern databases and lakehouses, governance, BI and analytics |
| 10 | Systems analysis and design |
| 11–12 | Networks and cloud infrastructure |
| 13 | Enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, SCM, HRIS) |
| 14–15 | Security of information assets and privacy/compliance |
| 16–17 | IS project management and IT service management |
| 18 | HCI and emerging topics |
| 19–23 | AI in IS — capabilities, responsible use, law, security, and productivity impact |
| 24–25 | Knowledge graphs, the Enterprise Knowledge Graph, and the Enterprise Nervous System |

### What Each Chapter Contains

Every chapter follows a consistent structure:

1. **YAML front matter** — Metadata at the top of each chapter file
   (title, description, reading level, version). Students don't see
   this; it's used by search engines and the website builder.
2. **Summary** — A brief overview of what the chapter covers and what
   students will learn.
3. **Concepts covered** — A numbered list of the specific concepts
   addressed in the chapter, drawn from the learning graph.
4. **Welcome from Iris** — A mascot admonition that introduces the
   chapter topic in Iris's friendly, slightly irreverent voice.
5. **Main content** — The core instructional material, written at a
   college sophomore/junior reading level. Includes tables,
   real-world examples, and embedded MicroSims.
6. **Mascot admonitions** — Throughout the chapter, Iris appears no
   more than 5–6 times to highlight key insights (`thinking`), offer
   practical tips (`tip`), provide encouragement on harder concepts
   (`encourage`), and warn about common pitfalls (`warning`).
7. **Key takeaways** — A numbered summary of the most important
   concepts, often preceded by a celebration from Iris.
8. **References** — A separate `references.md` page with curated
   further reading.

### Suggested Classroom Use

- **Before class:** Assign the chapter as reading homework. The
  MicroSims keep students engaged during independent reading.
- **During class:** Project the MicroSims for whole-class
  demonstrations. Ask students to predict what will happen when you
  change a slider, *then* test their predictions.
- **After class:** Assign the practice questions and the chapter
  quiz. Use the quiz scores to identify concepts that need
  re-teaching.
- **Pacing:** Each chapter is designed for approximately 2–3 class
  periods (90–135 minutes of instruction). Chapters with more
  MicroSims or more conceptual depth (notably 7, 13, 19, 24, and 25)
  may need an extra session.

## Using the MicroSims

### What is a MicroSim?

A **MicroSim** (short for "micro-simulation") is a small, interactive
simulation that runs directly in a web browser. Students don't need
to install any software — MicroSims work on any device with a modern
web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

Each MicroSim lets students manipulate one or more variables (using
sliders, buttons, or drag-and-drop) and immediately see how the model
responds. This "learn by doing" approach helps students build intuition
for abstract concepts.

### How MicroSims Are Embedded

MicroSims appear within chapter text as rectangular interactive areas.
They are embedded using **iframes** — a web technology that displays
one web page inside another. You don't need to understand how iframes
work; just know that the MicroSims load automatically when students
view the chapter page.

### Types of MicroSims

The textbook includes **43 MicroSims** built with different
visualization technologies:

| Technology | What It's Good For | Example MicroSims in This Book |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| **p5.js** | Interactive animations with sliders and buttons | Knowledge Triangle, DIKI Hierarchy Pyramid, Six-Component Model of an Information System |
| **Chart.js** | Bar, line, and pie charts | Sprint Burndown Chart, EVM Cost and Schedule Variance |
| **Plotly** | Advanced interactive charts with hover details | Bandwidth, Latency, and Throughput at a Glance |
| **vis-network** | Network and dependency diagrams | Learning Graph Viewer, Enterprise Network Topology |
| **Mermaid** | Flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and state diagrams from text | "Place Order" Sequence Diagram, "Loan Application Status" State Diagram, BPMN Order-to-Cash |

### Tips for Using MicroSims in Class

1. **Project them on a screen.** Most MicroSims are designed to be
   visible from the back of a classroom. Have students call out
   predictions before you move a slider.
2. **Let students explore independently.** After a demonstration, give
   students 5–10 minutes to experiment on their own devices.
3. **Use the "Reset" button.** Most MicroSims include a reset control.
   Encourage students to reset and try different scenarios.
4. **Connect to the text.** Each MicroSim is placed near the concept
   it illustrates. After exploring the sim, have students re-read the
   surrounding paragraph.
5. **Browse the full list.** The [MicroSims list](../sims/index.md)
   contains every interactive in the book. It's a great place to
   browse for an unscheduled "five minutes left in class" activity.

!!! mascot-tip "Iris's Tip: Embed MicroSims Anywhere!"
    <img src="../img/mascot/tip.png" class="mascot-admonition-img" alt="Iris shares a tip">
    You can embed any MicroSim into **any web page you control** — a
    Google Site, a WordPress blog, an LMS like Canvas or Schoology, or
    even a plain HTML file you hand a student. Paste a single line of
    HTML:

    ```html
    <iframe src="https://dmccreary.github.io/information-systems/sims/YOUR-MICROSIM-NAME/main.html"
        width="100%" height="450px" scrolling="no">
    </iframe>
    ```

    Replace `YOUR-MICROSIM-NAME` with the slug of any MicroSim from
    the [MicroSims list](../sims/index.md) (for example,
    `knowledge-triangle` or `bpmn-order-to-cash`). That's it — one
    line of code and your students have a live simulation right inside
    your course page.

### MicroSim Specifications

Within each chapter, you'll often find a collapsible **details**
section below a MicroSim. Click to expand and see the full
specification:

- **Bloom's Taxonomy level** — what cognitive level the MicroSim
  targets (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
- **Learning objective** — what students should be able to do after
  using the MicroSim
- **Interactive controls** — what sliders, buttons, and inputs are
  available
- **Default parameters** — the starting values when the MicroSim loads

These specifications are useful for lesson planning and for
understanding the pedagogical intent behind each simulation.

## Using the Glossary

### What is the Glossary?

The **glossary** is an alphabetical list of all key terms used in the
textbook (currently 64 terms), each with a precise, concise
definition. It serves as a quick-reference dictionary for students
encountering unfamiliar vocabulary.

### How to Access the Glossary

- Click **"Glossary"** in the left navigation sidebar from any page.
- Use the browser's built-in search (Ctrl+F on Windows/Linux, Cmd+F
  on Mac) to find a specific term on the glossary page.
- Use the site-wide **search bar** at the top of any page to search
  for a term across the entire textbook.

### Tips for Using the Glossary in Class

- **Vocabulary preview.** Before starting a new chapter, have students
  look up the key terms in the glossary to build familiarity.
- **Definition matching.** Create a warm-up activity where students
  match glossary definitions to terms from the current chapter.
- **Student-generated definitions.** After reading a chapter, have
  students write their own definitions, then compare with the
  glossary. The differences are often where understanding lives.
- **Glossary quizzes.** Use glossary terms for quick formative
  assessments (flash cards, quiz games, etc.).

## Using the FAQ

### What is the FAQ?

The **FAQ** (Frequently Asked Questions) is a curated list of common
questions students ask about information systems, organized by topic.
Each question includes a clear, concise answer written at the same
reading level as the chapters.

### How the FAQ is Organized

The FAQ covers questions across all 25 chapters. Questions are
grouped by topic area to make browsing easy.

### Tips for Using the FAQ in Class

- **Discussion starters.** Pick 2–3 FAQ questions at the start of
  class and have students discuss before revealing the answer.
- **Homework support.** Point students to the FAQ when they have
  questions outside of class hours.
- **Extension reading.** The FAQ often covers angles not addressed in
  the main chapter text, making it good supplementary material.
- **Test review.** Students can use the FAQ as a study guide before
  assessments.

## Using the Quizzes

### What Are the Quizzes?

Each chapter has an accompanying **quiz** with multiple-choice
questions designed for self-assessment. Quizzes test understanding of
the concepts covered in that chapter and are aligned to specific items
from the learning graph.

### How Quizzes Work

- Quizzes are accessed from the chapter's references and quiz pages
  (we are progressively adding a quiz to every chapter).
- Each quiz contains multiple-choice questions at varying Bloom's
  Taxonomy levels.
- Questions are presented as expandable sections — students can click
  to reveal the answer and explanation after attempting the question.
- Quizzes are **not graded automatically** — they are designed as
  formative self-check tools, not summative assessments.

### Tips for Using Quizzes in Class

- **Exit tickets.** Have students complete the quiz at the end of a
  class period as a quick check for understanding.
- **Pre-reading check.** Assign the quiz before the chapter to see
  what students already know (diagnostic assessment).
- **Post-reading review.** Use the quiz after reading to identify
  concepts that need re-teaching.
- **Collaborative quiz.** Have students work in pairs to discuss each
  question before revealing the answer.
- **Custom assessments.** Use the quiz questions as a bank to create
  your own tests. The questions are openly licensed (see
  "Understanding the License" below).

### Bloom's Taxonomy Levels

Each quiz question is tagged with a **Bloom's Taxonomy** level.
Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework that classifies thinking skills from
simple to complex:

| Level | Name | What It Means | Example Verb |
|-------|------|---------------|--------------|
| L1 | Remember | Recall facts and definitions | Define, list, name |
| L2 | Understand | Explain concepts in your own words | Explain, describe, compare |
| L3 | Apply | Use concepts to solve problems | Calculate, demonstrate, solve |
| L4 | Analyze | Break down and examine relationships | Differentiate, organize, compare |
| L5 | Evaluate | Make judgments based on criteria | Assess, argue, justify |
| L6 | Create | Produce original work or solutions | Design, construct, propose |

A well-balanced assessment includes questions across multiple levels.
The quizzes in this textbook primarily target levels L1–L4. The
practice questions and capstone projects in the chapters target
L5–L6.

## Using the References

### What Are the References?

Each chapter has an accompanying **references page** with a curated
list of approximately 10 high-quality sources for further reading.
References prioritize Wikipedia articles for accessibility and
reliability, supplemented by authoritative books, standards documents,
and research papers.

### How References Are Organized

Each reference includes:

- **Title** — The name of the source
- **URL** — A clickable link to the source
- **Relevance** — A brief description of why this source is useful
  and how it connects to the chapter content

### A Note About Link Rot

**Link rot** is when a web link (URL) stops working because the page
has been moved, renamed, or deleted. This is a common problem with
any resource that links to external websites. While we prioritize
Wikipedia (which has very stable URLs), some links may become outdated
over time.

If you or your students encounter a broken link:

1. Try searching for the article title on the source website.
2. Use the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) to find
   archived versions of the page.
3. Report the broken link using GitHub Issues (see "Feedback" below).

## Feedback

### Reporting Issues and Suggestions

This textbook is an open-source project hosted on **GitHub**, a
website where software and content projects are developed
collaboratively. You don't need to understand programming to report a
problem or suggest an improvement.

### What is a GitHub Issue?

A **GitHub Issue** is like a support ticket — it's a way to report a
bug, suggest an improvement, or ask a question. Each issue gets a
unique number and can be discussed by the project team and community.

### How to Submit Feedback

1. Go to the textbook's GitHub repository:
   [dmccreary/information-systems](https://github.com/dmccreary/information-systems)

3. Click the green **"New issue"** button.
4. Give your issue a clear title (e.g., "Broken link in Chapter 14
   references" or "Suggestion: Add a MicroSim for entity resolution").
5. In the description, provide as much detail as possible:
    - Which page or chapter has the problem
    - What you expected to see vs. what you actually see
    - Your browser and device (if relevant)
6. Click **"Submit new issue"**.

You will need a free GitHub account to submit issues. If you prefer
not to create an account, you can email feedback to the author using
the [Contact](../contact.md) page.

### Types of Feedback Welcome

- **Typos and errors** — factual mistakes, spelling errors, broken
  formatting

## Customizing Your Own Textbook

One of the most powerful features of this textbook is that you can
create your own customized version. Many instructors will want to do
exactly this — adapt the book to match their syllabus, their industry
context, or their students' background. This section explains how,
step by step.

### Key Technical Terms

Before we begin, here are some terms you'll need to understand:

- **Repository (repo)** — A folder on GitHub that contains all the
  files for a project. Think of it as the project's home directory.
- **Git** — A version control tool that tracks changes to files. It
  lets you see what changed, when, and by whom.
- **Clone** — Making a complete copy of a repository on your own
  computer.
- **Fork** — Making a complete copy of a repository on your own
  GitHub account (stays on GitHub, not your computer).
- **MkDocs** — The software that converts the textbook's Markdown
  files into a website. You don't need to learn MkDocs deeply — just
  enough to make basic changes.
- **Markdown** — A simple text formatting language. If you can write
  an email, you can write Markdown. `**bold**` makes **bold**,
  `# Heading` makes a heading, and `-` makes a bullet point.
- **mkdocs.yml** — The main configuration file for the textbook
  website. It controls the site title, navigation structure, colors,
  and which features are enabled.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

If you don't already have one, go to [github.com](https://github.com)
and create a free account.

### Step 2: Fork or Clone the Repository

**Option A: Fork (easier, stays on GitHub)**

1. Go to [dmccreary/information-systems](https://github.com/dmccreary/information-systems).
2. Click the **"Fork"** button in the upper-right corner.
3. This creates a copy in your own GitHub account that you can edit.

**Option B: Clone (more control, works on your computer)**

1. Install Git on your computer ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)).
2. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac).
3. Run this command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dmccreary/information-systems.git
    ```

This downloads the entire textbook to your computer.

### Step 3: Make Changes

All content files are in the `docs/` folder. They are written in
**Markdown** (`.md` files) — plain text files with simple formatting.
You can edit them with any text editor.

#### Changing the Title and Description

Open `mkdocs.yml` and edit these lines:

```yaml
site_name: "Your Custom Textbook Title"
site_description: "Your description here"
site_author: "Your Name"
```

#### Changing the Colors

This textbook uses a custom color palette defined in
`docs/css/extra.css`. To change it, open that file and adjust the CSS
variables for the primary and accent colors. If you'd rather use one
of the built-in MkDocs Material color schemes, change the `palette`
section in `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
theme:
  palette:
    - scheme: default
      primary: blue        # built-in: red, pink, purple, indigo, blue, teal, green, etc.
      accent: amber
```

#### Changing the Logo

Replace the file `docs/img/mascot/neutral.png` with your own logo
image (PNG format with a transparent background, approximately
128×128 pixels). Or replace the entire mascot family in
`docs/img/mascot/` with your own pedagogical agent.

### Step 4: Preview Your Changes Locally

1. Install Python (version 3.8 or newer) from [python.org](https://python.org).
2. Install MkDocs and the Material theme:

    ```bash
    pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
    ```

3. Navigate to the project folder and start the preview server:

    ```bash
    cd information-systems
    mkdocs serve
    ```

4. Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/information-systems/`
   to see your customized version.

The preview server watches for file changes. When you edit and save a
Markdown file, the page automatically refreshes in your browser.

### Step 5: Publish Your Version

To publish your customized textbook as a free website using GitHub
Pages:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This command builds the website and publishes it to
`https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/information-systems/`. The process
takes about 1–2 minutes.

## Customizing Your Analytics

### What is Web Analytics?

**Web analytics** is the process of measuring how visitors use a
website — which pages they visit, how long they stay, and where they
come from. For an educational textbook, analytics can help you
understand which chapters students read most, which MicroSims they
interact with, and where they might be struggling.

### Google Analytics

Many instructors will want to add **Google Analytics** — a free
service from Google that tracks website visits — to their forked
version of this textbook.

#### Setting Up Your Own Google Analytics

1. Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com/) and
   sign in with a Google account.
2. Create a new **property** (Google's term for a tracked website).
3. Google will give you a **Measurement ID** — a code that looks
   like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`.
4. In your `mkdocs.yml`, add this section under `extra`:

    ```yaml
    extra:
      analytics:
        provider: google
        property: G-YOUR-MEASUREMENT-ID
    ```

5. Rebuild and deploy your site. Analytics data will start appearing
   within 24–48 hours.

#### What You Can Learn from Analytics

- **Which chapters are most/least visited** — helps you identify
  where students might be skipping content.
- **Average time on page** — longer times may indicate engagement or
  confusion. (Both are useful signals.)
- **Device breakdown** — what percentage of students use phones vs.
  computers.
- **Geographic distribution** — where your students are accessing
  from.
- **Search terms** — what students search for on your site.

### xAPI Monitoring (Advanced)

**xAPI** (Experience API, also called "Tin Can API") is an advanced
standard for tracking detailed learning activities — not just page
views, but specific interactions like "student moved a slider to
position X" or "student answered quiz question 3 correctly."

#### What is an LRS?

An **LRS** (Learning Record Store) is a database that stores xAPI
learning records. Think of it as a specialized analytics system
designed specifically for education. If you use an LRS, you can track
granular student learning data.

#### Important: Regulatory Considerations

Before collecting student-specific learning data, be aware of these
regulations:

- **FERPA** (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) — U.S. federal
  law that protects student education records. If you collect data
  that can identify individual students, you must comply with FERPA.
- **COPPA** (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) — U.S. federal
  law that applies to children under 13. (Likely not a concern for
  this college-level textbook, but worth knowing.)
- **State laws** — Many U.S. states have additional student privacy
  laws.
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) — European Union law
  that applies if any of your students are in the EU.

**Recommendation:** The Google Analytics setup described above is
anonymous by default — it tracks aggregate page views, not individual
students. This is the safest approach. If you want individual student
tracking via xAPI, consult your institution's data privacy officer
*before* turning anything on. Chapters 15 (Privacy and Compliance)
and 21 (AI Law) cover the underlying obligations in more depth, and
they apply to *you as an operator of an educational website* just as
much as to the businesses your students will eventually work for.

### Building a Student Progress Dashboard with AI

As AI tools become more accessible, it is becoming possible to build
custom dashboards that visualize student progress through the
textbook — for example:

- Which chapters each student has completed
- Quiz scores over time
- MicroSim engagement levels
- Concepts that need re-teaching based on quiz performance

Building such a dashboard requires programming knowledge (Python,
JavaScript) and careful attention to student data privacy. This is an
advanced topic beyond the scope of this guide, but the open-source
nature of this textbook means all the data structures are available
for developers to build upon.

## The Learning Graph

### What is a Learning Graph?

A **learning graph** is a visual map showing how concepts in the
textbook depend on each other. It is structured as a **DAG** (Directed
Acyclic Graph) — a diagram where arrows show which concepts must be
understood before others.

For example, understanding the Enterprise Knowledge Graph (Chapter 24)
requires students to first understand graph data models, ontologies,
and entity resolution — and those depend on earlier ideas about data
modeling and master data management. The learning graph makes these
dependency chains visible.

This textbook's learning graph contains **580 concepts** spanning all
25 chapters.

### How Instructors Can Use the Learning Graph

- **Prerequisite checking.** Before teaching a concept, verify that
  students have covered its prerequisites in earlier chapters.
- **Remediation.** If a student struggles with a concept, trace back
  to its prerequisites to find the gap.
- **Curriculum mapping.** Compare the learning graph to your existing
  syllabus to identify coverage gaps. This is especially useful for
  programs pursuing or maintaining ABET CAC accreditation.
- **Enrichment.** Advanced students can explore concepts ahead of the
  current chapter by following the graph forward.

The interactive **Learning Graph Viewer** is available in the
"Learning Graph" section of the left navigation, and the underlying
data lives in `docs/learning-graph/`.

## Iris the Hummingbird: Your Pedagogical Agent

### What is a Pedagogical Agent?

A **pedagogical agent** is a character that appears throughout a
textbook to guide students. Research shows that pedagogical agents
improve student engagement and perception of learning — a phenomenon
called the **persona effect**.

### Meet Iris

Iris is an emerald-green hummingbird with a ruby-magenta gorget and
wire-rim glasses. She has, somehow, read every IS textbook. Her voice
is warm, playful, and slightly irreverent — she is the smartest,
most enthusiastic TA your students will ever meet, and she genuinely
believes that ERP cutover plans are interesting.

### How Iris Appears

Iris appears as colored callout boxes (called **admonitions**)
throughout each chapter. There are seven types:

| Type | Color | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Welcome** | Green | Introduces the chapter | Every chapter opening |
| **Thinking** | Orange | Highlights key insights | 1–2 per chapter |
| **Tip** | Green | Shares practical advice | As needed |
| **Warning** | Red | Alerts to common mistakes | As needed |
| **Encourage** | Blue | Supports on harder concepts | Where students may struggle |
| **Celebration** | Purple | Celebrates progress | Every chapter ending |

Iris appears no more than 5–6 times per chapter. Mascot admonitions
are never placed back-to-back, so when Iris speaks up, it's worth
pausing on.

### Tips for Instructors

- **Read Iris's admonitions aloud.** They are written in a
  conversational tone that works well when spoken in class.
- **Use them as discussion prompts.** Iris's `thinking` admonitions
  highlight the most important insights in each chapter — they are
  often the perfect "stop and discuss" moment.
- **Direct struggling students to her.** When a student is bouncing
  off a concept, point them to the `encourage` admonition for that
  chapter. The voice was designed for exactly that moment.
- **Treat the `warning` admonitions as exam-worthy.** They flag the
  classic pitfalls that 80% of practitioners stumble over. If it's
  worth Iris's time to warn about, it's probably worth a test
  question.
